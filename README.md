## Overview

- For this project we are using the npm inquirer package and the built fs package for node js. I have also added the path package that is also built into node js. With the inquirer package I have created questions that will require an input from the user. This input will then be used to create a professional Team Profile (newTeam.html) webpage for a company. We are given no starter code.
