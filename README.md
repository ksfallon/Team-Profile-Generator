## Overview

- Our task is the create an application that builds a website with profiles of a software engineering team. We must use node.js to create it and we will use npm Inquirer to collect user input to build the site. We will use the module fs to create paths between js files, so functions from different pages can communicate. The path module is used to connect files and directory paths.
- We were not given starter code for this project. But we were given suggestions for folders to create to help us separate the different files we would need to create.
